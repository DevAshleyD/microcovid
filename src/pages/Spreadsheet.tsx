          <li>
            <strong>Activity logging:</strong> You want to log your activity
            over time to make sure youâ€™re staying within your intended budget.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Custom Person Risk modeling:</strong> You want to model more
            exactly the risk of a person you are seeing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Household/pod risk budgeting:</strong> You live with others
            or have other people you are seeing on a regular basis and want to
            keep track of your budget. (The{' '}
            <Link to="#">households and pods page</Link> introduces this
            approach in detail.)

            Accurately modeling the people youâ€™re interacting with often results
            in you using less points for each activity, which means you can do
            more things.
